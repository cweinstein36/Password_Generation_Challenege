# Password Generation Challenge

## Description
This is an odd week of the bootcamp so we are modifying starter code that was provided to us. During this challenge we will be creating an application that generates a random password for an employee  based on certain criteria they have selected. Those criteria are as follows:
1) How many characters do you want the password to be?
2) Do you want lowercase letters in your password?
3) Do you want uppercase letters in your password?
4) Do you want uppercase letters in your password?
5) Do you want numbers in your password?

After all 5 questions are filled out then the password is generated in the password field.

## Usage 
This is intened to be used for employees or anyone to generate a more secure password for login.
